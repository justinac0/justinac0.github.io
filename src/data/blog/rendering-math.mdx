# Rendering Math Fundamentals

Have you ever wondered how computers display 3D graphics?
In this blog I will attempt to demistify an aspect of this,
specifically the mathematics required to render geometric
primitives in a rasterization-based rendering library
(like [OpenGL](https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/FAQ#What_is_OpenGL),
or [DirectX]()).
I would recommend that spend some time learning  
[linear algebra](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/)
if you haven't encountered it before reading this blog. If not, no worries, there
will be some [helpful links](#helpful-resources) at the end to help you suppliment
your learning.
