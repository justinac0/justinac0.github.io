# Rendering Math Fundamentals

## Introduction
Have you ever wondered how computers display 3D graphics?
How can we depict 3D environment on a '2D' monitor/screen?
In this blog I will attempt to demistify this process.

Before I get into it I just have a couple of things to say,
I will not be covering the basics of graphics APIs, as the main
focus is math not graphics programming. If you happen to be
interested in that [this](https://learnopengl.com/Getting-started/Hello-Triangle)
is a great place to start.

## Key Point(s)

The key to transforming geometric primitives into 3D requires the multiplication of three matricies against some vertex position.

<Latex formula='\vec{v_p}\prime=PVM\vec{v_p}'/>
{/* - **Model Matrix (M):**
- **View Matrix (V):**
- **Perspective Matrix (P):**
- **Projected Vertex Position (<Latex formula='\vec{v_p}\prime' />):**
- **Vertex Position (<Latex formula='\vec{v_p}' />):** */}

An example of this matrix multiplication in [GLSL](https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Core_Language_(GLSL)) looks something like this (vertex shader):
```glsl
// NOTE(reader): I intentionally left out code
// relating to fragments because this blog is
// more about math than implementation to
// rendering pipelines
layout (location = 0) in vec3 vertices;

uniform mat4 P;
uniform mat4 V;
uniform mat4 T;

void main() {
    gl_Position = P * V * T * vec4(vertices, 1);
}
```

## Vectors

![](/blog/rendering-math/vector.png)

Pointing is rude! We'll that's a vectors purpose, yes to be rude...whoops
I mean to point. They're a mathematical tool to describe some line
of some discrete length that points in some direction. Vectors have a
tail (starting position), head (end position) and some length (magnitude).

If you have ever taking a physics class you have surely run into them before.
In the image above we see the vector <Latex formula='\vec{A}=(2,3)' />, this
is called a 2D vector. Vectors can be described in any number of dimensions;
however, we will be primarily focusing on 3D vectors.

### Operations 
*ADD:* <Latex formula='\vec{a}+\vec{b}=\\' />
*SUBTRACT:* <Latex formula='\vec{a}-\vec{b}=\\' />
*MULTIPLY:* <Latex formula='\vec{a}\times\vec{b}=\\' />
*DOT:* <Latex formula='\vec{a}\cdot\vec{b}=\\' />
*CROSS:* <Latex formula='\vec{a}\times\vec{b}=\\' />
*MAGNITUDE:* <Latex formula='|\vec{a}|=\\' />
*UNIT:* <Latex formula='\hat{a}=\frac{\vec{a}}{|\vec{a}|}\\' />

## Matrices

### Operations
*ADD:* <Latex formula='AB\\' />
*SUB:* <Latex formula='AB\\' />
*MULTIPLY:* <Latex formula='AB\\' />
*TRANSPOSE:* <Latex formula='A^T\\' />
